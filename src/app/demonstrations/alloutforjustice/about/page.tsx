          The cycle of violence in Palestine started with the zionist movement
          <br />
          We believe a truly peaceful world can not be attained without justice
          which will not be attained through apartheid
          <br />
          Racial segragation is a crime against humanity and we will not stand
          by while some humans are seen as less than others
          <br />
          And are being killed, displaced and cut off water, electricty and food
          in the name of peace and self-defense
          <br />
          It is time for us to unite to end this injustice against Palestinians,
          and find a real solution built on justice
          <br />
          We are the generation that can end this cycle of violence
          <br />
          We could be the generation of true liberation and equal rights
          <br />
          We could be the generation that chooses love over fear, and end this
          injustice

          But now our eyes are open. <br /> We will not let this just happen and
          stand helpless with our tax dollars, OUR money. <br /> We will not let
          the US terrorize and kill innocent people in Palestine in the name of
          peace and self-defense. <br /> This has been going on for so long
          because the people at the top only understand power and money. <br />{" "}
          The concepts of justice, humanity, and fairness are too far-fetched
          for them to grasp. <br /> So letâ€™s bring it to their level. <br />{" "}
          <br /> This march for justice will talk money. <br /> A peaceful
          marchâ€” we will start by sitting down together in a park, hand in hand.
          choosing love over fear. <br /> Then, we will vote towards justice
          with our dollars, all together, collectively. <br /> We will put our
